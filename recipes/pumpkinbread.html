<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe will walk you through making your favorite pumpkin loaf recipe from start to finish!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups unsifted all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 can (1lb) pumpkin</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by combining the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and spices. I like to add everything in neat little piles in case I lose track of what Iâ€™ve added.</li>
            <li>Whisk well and set aside</li>
            <li>Combine the butter and sugar in a large bowl or in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat just until combined. It will look crumbly.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating for a few minutes until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the pumpkin. Beat until combined. It will look a little grainy - that's okay.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture. Beat on a low speed until just combined.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to loaf pans. Bake for 65-75 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Let the loaves cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>That's all there is to it. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
